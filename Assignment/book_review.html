            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>On October 14, 1892, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, by Arthur Conan Doyle, is published. The book was
                the
                first collection of Holmes stories, which Conan Doyle had been publishing in magazines since 1887.

                Conan Doyle was born in Scotland and studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh, where he met Dr.
                Joseph Bell, a teacher with extraordinary deductive power. Bell partly inspired Doyle’s character
                Sherlock
                Holmes years later.

                After medical school, Conan Doyle moved to London, where his slow medical practice left him ample free
                time
                to write. His first Sherlock Holmes story, “A Study in Scarlet,” was published in Beeton’s Christmas
                Annual
                in 1887. Starting in 1891, a series of Holmes stories appeared in The Strand magazine, and Conan Doyle
                was
                able to give up his medical practice and devote himself to writing.

                Later collections include The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes (1894), The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1905),
                and
                The Casebook of Sherlock Holmes (1927). In 1902, Conan Doyle was knighted for his work with a field
                hospital
                in South Africa. In addition to dozens of Sherlock Holmes stories and several novels, Conan Doyle wrote
                history, pursued whaling, and engaged in many adventures and athletic endeavors. After his son died in
                World
                War I, Conan Doyle became a dedicated spiritualist. He died in 1930.</p>
            <h3>Review</h3>
            <p>My Goodreads review: Following Sherlock Holmes through a series of his investigations with Watson is
                really
                engaging. Most of them always start with some form of peculiar detail and then turns around to change
                around
                just from the little details that he observes. That is the charm of Sherlock Holmes and it keeps us
                wondering what his next step is and how each case will end. Its a very enjoyable read.

                This is a book with 12 investigations of the adventures of Sherlock Holmes. Dr. Watson, his trusted
                companion, is the narrator of each of these stories. He documents each one through his eyes and his
                experience. When Holmes exits the picture or when certain characters involved in the case leave his
                field of
                vision, we jump forward to when he witnesses some more. This allows us a lot of mystery as we read. We
                know
                that its the most accurate version from Watson`s mouth and this is also what pulls us in. He puts in his
                initial assessment and then his discussion with Holmes who clarifies his route of action most of the
                time
                after the fact.</p>

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>The unforgettable novel of a childhood in a sleepy Southern town and the crisis of conscience that rocked
                it, To Kill A Mockingbird became both an instant bestseller and a critical success when it was first
                published in 1960. It went on to win the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and was later made into an Academy
                Award-winning film, also a classic.

                Compassionate, dramatic, and deeply moving, To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee takes readers to the
                roots of human behavior – to innocence and experience, kindness and cruelty, love and hatred, humor and
                pathos.
                Now with over 18 million copies in print and translated into forty languages, this regional story by a
                young Alabama woman claims universal appeal. Harper Lee always considered her book to be a simple love
                story. Today it is regarded as a masterpiece of American literature.</p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <h3>Review</h3>
            <p>The narrator of this story is young tomboy Jean Louise (Scout), and her observations of Maycomb and
                people’s behavior are simple, honest, and visually very rich. I had no problem picturing Scout, Jem and
                Dill’s childish efforts to draw Boo Radley out of his house, or Calpurnia taking the kids to a colored
                church.

                But when, after 128 pages, the court case begins and the plot really becomes intriguing, you immediately
                feel a rise in tension and excitement. Here Jem and Atticus become the main characters instead of Scout
                because they are more aware of the risks and importance of the case, although Scout’s moment with the
                mob was heartwrenchingly beautiful in it’s innocence.</p>
